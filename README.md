##  **Learning outcomes**  


`You will practice using mathematics and Python in everyday tasks and learn how to use third-party modules and libraries. You will also learn more about different financial instruments.`  


<ul>
	<li>the calculation of differentiated payment. To do this, the user may run the program specifying interest, count of periods and credit principal.</li>
	<li>
	<p>a capacity to calculate the same values as in the previous stage for annuity payment (principal, count of periods and value of the payment). A user specifies all known parameters with command-line arguments, while a single parameter will be unknown. This is the value the user wants to calculate.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>handling of invalid parameters. It's a good idea to show an error message <code class="java">Incorrect parameters</code> in case of invalid parameters (they are discussed in detail below).</p>
	</li>
</ul>
